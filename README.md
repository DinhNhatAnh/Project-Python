1. [Prediction Price Car by Linear Regression model](https://github.com/DinhNhatAnh/Project-Python/blob/master/Prediction%20Price%20Car%20by%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)

  The objective of this project:
  - EDA (Explortory Data Analysis)
  - To find the relationship between variables and the factors that impact to the price car.
  - Using Linear Regression model to predict price car based on datasets.

2. [Prediction Survivability of a person in Titanic by Logistic Regression model](https://github.com/DinhNhatAnh/Project-Python/blob/master/Prediction%20Survived%20Titanic%20by%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
